# Lead-to-Delivery-Funnel-Performance-Dashboard-ElectricPe-

This project analyzes the EV sales funnel and store performance for ElectricPe, covering the customer journey from lead → pre-booking → booking → delivery, along with cancellations and customer satisfaction (NPS).
The goal was to identify bottlenecks, improve conversion, and optimize operations using Excel analytics & dashboarding.

Dashboard Overview

1. Lead-to-Delivery funnel by store
2. Stage-wise TAT (turnaround time) performance
3. Cancellations by reason & store
4. Hot/Warm/Cold lead analysis
5. Customer rating distribution & NPS
6. Filters & slicers for store and lead type

Built using PivotTables, lookup formulas, calculated KPIs, slicers, conditional formatting, and chart-based visuals.
